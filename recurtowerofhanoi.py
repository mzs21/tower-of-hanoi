# Recursive approach

'''
To solve the puzzle with recursion, the first thing to do is break the original problem down into smaller sub-problems.

The final configuration with n disks piled up to the third rod in decreasing order can be obtained by moving:

n - 1 disks from the source to the auxiliary rod
the largest disk from the source to the target
and then the n - 1 disks from the auxiliary rod to the target.
So, the first thing the move function should do is calling itself with n - 1 as the first argument. But if you try to do so without defining a base case, you will get a RecursionError. This happens because the function keeps calling itself indefinitely.

A = list(range(NUMBER_OF_DISKS, 0, -1))

def move(n, source, auxiliary, target):
    if n <= 0: # Base case. If n is less than or equal to 0, it will return
        return
        
    # move n - 1 disks from source to auxiliary, so they are out of the way
    move(n - 1, source, target, auxiliary)
    
    # move the nth disk from source to target
    target.append(source.pop())
    
    # display our progress
    print(A, B, C, '\n')
    
    # move the n - 1 disks that we left on auxiliary onto target
    move(n - 1,  auxiliary, source, target)
              
# initiate call from source A to target C with auxiliary B
move(NUMBER_OF_DISKS, A, B, C)
    

# initiate call from source A to target C with auxiliary B
move(NUMBER_OF_DISKS, 'A', 'B', 'C')
